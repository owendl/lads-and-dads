# Lads & Dads

## Objective
To create a hack of Lasers & Feelings that centers on a group of friends re-uniting after some time apart, in early middle age. This game seeks to highlight the tension between 
* lads: chasing good stories, riding the waves of life
* dads: seeking out responsibilites, taking ownership of your life

Where the friends know each other from is decided at the start, prior to character creation
